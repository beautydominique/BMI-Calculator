        <h3>Risks associated with being overweight</h3>
        <p class="p-container"></p>Being overweight increases the risk of a number of serious diseases and health conditions.
        Below is a list of said risks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):</p>
        <ul class="ul-container">
            <li>High blood pressure</li>
            <li>Higher levels of LDL cholesterol, which is widely considered "bad cholesterol," lower levels of HDL cholesterol, considered to be good cholesterol in moderation, and high levels of triglycerides</li>
            <li>Type II diabetes</li>
            <li>Coronary heart disease</li>
            <li>Stroke</li>
            <li>Gallbladder disease</li>
            <li>Osteoarthritis, a type of joint disease caused by breakdown of joint cartilage</li>
            <li>Sleep apnea and breathing problems</li>
            <li>Certain cancers (endometrial, breast, colon, kidney, gallbladder, liver)</li>
            <li>Low quality of life</li>
            <li>Mental illnesses such as clinical depression, anxiety, and others</li>
            <li>Body pains and difficulty with certain physical functions</li>
            <li>Generally, an increased risk of mortality compared to those with a healthy BMI</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As can be seen from the list above, there are numerous negative, in some cases fatal, outcomes that may result from being overweight. Generally, a person should try to maintain a BMI below 25 kg/m2, 
            but ideally should consult their doctor to determine whether or not they need to make any changes to their lifestyle in order to be healthier.
        </p>
